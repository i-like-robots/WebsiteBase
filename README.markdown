# WebsiteBase

[WebsiteBase](http://i-like-robots.github.com/WebsiteBase) is more than a boilerplate. It combines ideas from [OOCSS](http://oocss.org/) and [SMACSS](http://smacss.com) to help create a maintainable code base for large scale websites.

* Documented CSS caveats and code notes
* Organised project structure
* Guidelines for stylesheet and Javascript code style
* Cross-browser form elements
* Nestable grid
* Useful layout classes to get stuff done
* Basic legacy Internet Explorer fixes
