# WebsiteBase

[WebsiteBase](http://i-like-robots.github.com/WebsiteBase) is more than a boilerplate. It combines ideas from [OOCSS](http://oocss.org/) and [SMACSS](http://smacss.com) to help create a maintainable code base for large scale websites.

* Documented CSS caveats and code notes
* Scalable project structure and conventions
* Guidelines for HTML, CSS and JavaScript coding style
* A full set of CSS3 [LESS](http://lesscss.org/)
* Neat typography, baseline and text-variations out of the box
* Re-usable layout classes with accompanying [Zen-Coding](http://code.google.com/p/zen-coding/) formulas
* Cross-browser forms elements and layouts with helpful user hints variations for buttons
* A nestable grid structure with no first or last classes required
