# WebsiteBase

[WebsiteBase](http://i-like-robots.github.com/Website-base) is a solid project starting point, defining code organisation and formatting along with useful classes, cross-browser form layouts and text content baseline. WebsiteBase should make starting a project much less of a pain.

## Not an over-engineeered boilerplate and more than a reset.

WebsiteBase features:

* Well documented
* Text content baseline
* Cross-browser form layouts
* Useful formatting classes
* Basic IE6/7 fixes
