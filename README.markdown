# WebsiteBase

[WebsiteBase](http://i-like-robots.github.com/WebsiteBase) is more than a boilerplate. As well as normalising and fixing inconsistant browser styles it attempts to add common sense and boundries to your code. WebsiteBase attempts to keep everyone on the same page over the life of a project as well as helping developers hit the ground running.

* Documented CSS caveats and code notes
* Very organised project structure
* Guidelines for stylesheet and Javascript coding style
* Cross-browser form elements
* Useful layout classes to get stuff done
* Basic Internet Explorer 6/7 fixes
