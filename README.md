# WebsiteBase

[WebsiteBase](http://i-like-robots.github.com/WebsiteBase) is more than a boilerplate, less than a framework and great place for front-end developers to start new projects. It combines ideas from [OOCSS](http://oocss.org/) and [SMACSS](http://smacss.com) to help create an opinionated code base for scalable and maintainable website development.

* Scalable and maintainable structure and conventions, encouraging abstraction and code re-use.
* Utilizes the power of [LESS](http://lesscss.com) to reduce development type, including CSS3 mixins
* Fully documented CSS caveats and [Zen-Coding](http://code.google.com/p/zen-coding/) formulas.
* Normalised form elements and graceful form layouts out of the box.
* Abstracted, re-usable and responsive layout components.

*WebsiteBase requires LESS 1.3.1 or above*
