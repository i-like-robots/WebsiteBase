All:
- Indent work with tabs. No spaces unless vertically aligning for readability.
- Do not leave trailing whitespace or whitespace on empty lines.
- Use UTF-8 encoding with UNIX line endings for consistancy.

CSS:
- Indent your CSS to denote a selector is a child of or extends a previous selector. Comment extensions.
- Name classes sensibly using hyphens if necessary. No CamelCase.
- Order and group properties sensibly, I suggest: 1. layout 2. text 3. backgrounds 4. fluffy stuff
- No inline hacks or parsing bugs for IE specific rules; put it in to the right stylesheet.
- Enhance sensibly. Use duplicate rules that will fall back (A CSS parser ignores what it doesn't understand).
- Run test code through CSSLint or Page Speed to pick out obvious bugs (this also means keeping selectors short and using pre-defined font sizes and colours as much as possible)
- If you over-specify or use pseudo-element or attribute selectors leave a comment to explain why it is necessary.

Javascript:
- Keep jQuery factory selectors as simple as possible (IDs, tags and classes) and use traverse methods when necessary E.G. $this.find('.something')
- Cache jQuery objects if you need to access them more than once and prefix with a dollar sign E.G. $this = $(this), that = 'that';
- Test using JSHint to avoid obvious bugs.
- Use JSDoc to comment methods and provide an example if relying on existing or building new markup.
- Don't just throw a plug-in at a page to solve a problem. Use of a plug-in should be evaluated and agreed upon by all developers.
